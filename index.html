In the last decade, destructive urban policies elaborated in Europe and the United States moved swiftly towards Latin America, Africa and Asia, imposing in the entire world the opening of boulevards, the erection of infrastructures or high-rise buildings, the eviction of working-class residents from the city center, and their relocation in peripheral areas, if not in the countryside.</p><figure class="post__image"><a href="https://www.ijurr.org/news/eviction-and-displacement-from-the-neighbourhood-of-douar-wasti-in-casablanca-morocco/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03-624x351.png" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" srcset="https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03-624x351.png 624w, https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ijurr.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-03-at-10.41.03.png 1138w" alt="" width="380" height="214" data-is-external-image="true"></a></figure><p></p><p lang="en-US" align="justify">These enormous spatial transformations <strong>have an impact</strong> not only on individual lives, or on communities; they also influence, though in ways we still only envisage, the basic aspects of human life: culture, society, politics, religion.</p><p lang="en-US" align="justify">Forced mobility is the other face of forced immobility: together, they represent the violation of the right to self-determination of movement and stillness. Each person may need either to move or to stay, depending on the resources available, on the changes of climate, on the form of the territories, and on many other factors. Instead of distinguishing between nomads and settlers, migrants and natives, tourists and travelers, let us imagine a world without borders: <strong>movement and stillness are part of the everyday life of all</strong>.</p><p lang="en-US" align="justify">Every productive order, however, requires a specific spacial form. Nation states require a structured and legible distribution of the population, often imposed with violence on people who are organized in a different spatial configuration. States may impose circulation or sheltering-in-place, prohibit to cross some limits, to reside in a specific place, or force to move somewhere else. <strong>Permanence and control over movements</strong> are the criteria through which all bureaucracies identify their citizens; those who do not obey may suffer contempt, marginalization, or violence.</p><blockquote><figure class="size-full wp-image-62027 align-center"><a href="https://napolimonitor.it/il-diritto-di-restare-espulsioni-e-radicamento-tra-roma-e-ostia-un-estratto-dal-libro-di-stefano-portelli/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://napolimonitor.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ostia.png" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" srcset="https://napolimonitor.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ostia.png 574w, https://napolimonitor.it/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ostia-300x258.png 300w" alt="" width="404" height="348" data-is-external-image="true"></a></figure><p></p></blockquote><p lang="en-US" align="justify"><strong>Forced mobility is the other face of forced immobility: together, they represent the violation of the right to self-determination of movement and stillness.</strong> States force people to stay put when they need to move – blocking them at the frontiers, enclosing them in prisons and detention centers, denying travel documents or imposing selective “red zones” on public spaces. States, though, also force to move people that would need to stay put. Entire communities are removed, people are pushed to leave their villages or neighborhoods, or chased out from their homes, as bulldozers and caterpillars tear down buildings, houses, facilities, worship sites. The areas that are cleared are enclosed and reorganized according to new criteria, based on the needs of people different than those that lived there.</p><p lang="en-US" align="justify"><strong>Forced displacement</strong> often hits communities that have already been affected from displacement. So-called “slum residents” that fled to the city after land grabbing, or dispossession of their rural areas, may see the interstitial zones they came to inhabit threatened of new evictions, if the governments need them for new infrastructures, or to attract wealthier people. As the urban population of the planet grows, discrimination has become largely spatial: it is not only access to resources that guarantees status, but the possibility of choosing between staying and moving. Some people are allowed to choose, other people are not.</p><p lang="en-US" align="justify">Even when there are reasonable motives for forced displacement, as happens with so-called “natural” catastrophes, relocation is inevitably oriented by private profit, territorial control, or political advantage of a few<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>. In February 2024 the Moroccan magazine <i>Tel Quel </i>opened the cover page with the title <i>The Bulldozer State </i>(<i>L’État bulldozer</i>): thousands of houses had been demolished to erect hotels and tourist facilities, overlapping with the destruction caused by the 20230 earthquake<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a>. Smaller events of this kind happen every day in the cities we inhabit.</p><p lang="en-US" align="justify">A line of continuity connects big and small episodes of displacement, from the constant evictions of people who cannot pay their rents or mortgages, to the evictions of occupied buildings and squats, to the demolition of so-called “slums” or “shanty towns”, to the big expulsions caused by land-grabbing, or the demolitions of entire neighborhoods. Events like the <a href="https://www.monitor-italia.it/cadere-nel-vuoto-sulla-morte-di-uno-sfrattato-a-barcellona/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suicide of an evictee</a> in Barcelona, after fifteen years of forced mobility, reproduce at a smaller scale the catastrophe of armed conflict, ethnic cleansing, and genocide: to remove people from their lands, or from their houses, some States are ready to spill their blood.</p><figure class="image-preview__image image-preview__image--loaded"><img src="https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/1200x630/612664395a40232133447d33247d38313032353033383037" alt="Bon Pastor in Barcelona, Spain | Sygic Travel" loading="lazy" data-v-e0ce9055="" data-test-id="image-preview-image" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>Obviously, the damage caused by urban displacement is not comparable with the tragedies of war and conquest, nor with the forced mobility provoked by environmental and climatic catastrophe. The United Nations calculated that in 2022 <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hundred million people worldwide</a> were forced to leave their houses: if the displaced were a country, it would be the fourteenth more populated in the world. International agencies that support refugees closely monitor the huge movements of population produced by catastrophes, as well as by war and military invasions, such as happens in Palestine, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine, Congo. To the contrary, people displaced by so-called development projects, mostly forced to relocate inside the same country or even the same city, are generally monitored only by informal groups of housing or environmental activists, tenants’ unions, and local organizations that defend residents against evictions and foreclosures.</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://bulldozerstate.github.io/in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
